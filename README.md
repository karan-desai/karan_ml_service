# karan_ml_service

Objective : Create an service that will be predicts the salary of a person based on the demographics, education etc using machine learning algorithms

Tools used: Python, Jupyter notebook, Django Framework, Rest APIs 

Libraries used: pandas, scikit-learn, joblib, numpy, requests, django, rest_framework, 

Steps involved in Project:

1. Create a repository on github, virtual environment and Django framework in development environment. (Develop environment- Here Anaconda)

2. Install all the required packages and jump start the jupyter notebook. 

3. Read the dataset, do the required preprocessing and make an machine learning model with scikit-learn library. 

4. Save preprocessing objects and models using *joblib library*.

5. Define database models in models.py file of the Django framework and update the variable "Installed apps" in setting.py file. 

6. Create REST API to make requests by writing views.py, urls.py and serializers.py file using objects and models created by joblib and Django framework. 

7. Run the migration command and run the server. 

8. Request the prediction via urls generated by the REST API. (For output see python notebook- request prediction)
